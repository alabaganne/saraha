### Saraha server app

# How to run?
Make sure you're in the server directory and run the following 3 commands:
```
npm install
npm run start
```
The first command will install all the necessary libraries/packages to run the server
And the second one will start the server

NOTE: in the connection.js file, change user to "root", password to "" and host to "localhost"
